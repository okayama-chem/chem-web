description : "The Department of Chemistry has three major courses: Molecular Chemistry (Physical Chemistry), Material Chemistry (Inorganic and Analytical Chemistry), and Reaction Chemistry (Organic Chemistry), and is staffed with personnel capable of covering and teaching a wide range of research areas in chemistry. A distinctive feature of the department is that it maintains a research system that enables the analysis of the geometrical and electronic structures of molecules and molecular assemblies and, based on these results, the state analysis at the molecular level of the synthesis, physical properties, and reactivity of more macroscopic inorganic and organic compounds. Through research in these areas, we aim to elucidate the correlation between material structure and functional expression, and to create new materials with high functionality."
