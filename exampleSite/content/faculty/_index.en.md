description : "The Department of Chemistry consists of three research fields: Molecular Chemistry (Physical Chemistry), Reaction Chemistry (Organic Chemistry), and Material Chemistry (Inorganic and Analytical Chemistry), covering a wide range of chemistry research areas including interdisciplinary fields. The number of faculty members is high in relation to the number of students, and students and faculty members are close to each other, making it possible to provide small-group education in which each student receives individual attention."
